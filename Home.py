                    This web app contains tools used to analyse the quality of church bellringing in the English tradition.
        There are two main parts to this: \\
                    1. Analysing a raw audio input to determine the times at which the bells strike. \\
                    2. Displaying this data in a way which is meaningfully useful. \\
        There already exists software to accomplish this, namely Hawkear and Strikeometer, respectively. 
                    This new app is designed completely differently from these and is more focused on less technical analysis than the high-quality 12 bell touches people usually focus on with this kind of software. \\
                    Notably, this new method can use (reasonably) noisy ringing chamber audio, and does not require any calibration beorehand. 
                    I don't intend this as a replacement for the existing software -- with the same input Hakwear will probably provide more reliable results -- but this does open up this kind of analysis to more everday ringing, and can hopefully be used to help ringing improve in general.

    st.write('### Limitations (more tbc)')
    st.markdown('''
        As you might expect, the audio input must be reasonably clear -- if you can't pick out all the bells most of the time then this probably won't manage it. Some towers just work better than others. Any audio which works for Hakwear *should* be OK here though.\\
        The algorithm is designed to look for good, open handstroke ringing. Analysing bad ringing can be quite amusing but once the rhythm is lost that's very difficult for it to figure out. \\
        This site is very limited by how much memory I can use for free. So please just use this for short touches... If someone fancies paying for a better server, do let me know.
        The basis of detecting the initial rhythm is the tenor. If the tenor is not being rhythmic or is particularly oddstruck then it probably work. Also if there is a partiaurly harmonic bell louder than the tenor this can cause problems.
