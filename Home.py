                        This web app contains tools used to analyse the quality of church bellringing in the English tradition.
            This process is split into two distinct parts: \\
                        1. Analysing a raw recording to determine the times at which the bells strike. \\
                        2. Displaying this data in a way which is meaningful. \\
                    \\
            There already exists software to accomplish this, namely (respectively) HawkEar and Strikeometer. 
                        This new app is designed quite differently from these and is more focused on less technical analysis than the high-quality 12 bell touches people usually focus on with this kind of software. \\
                        Notably, the new method for audio analysis can use (reasonably) noisy ringing chamber recordings, and does not require any calibration beforehand. It achieves using new audio filtering techniques which I've figured out expressly for this purpose.\\
                    \\
                        This is not a replacement for or an update to the existing software -- with the same input HawkEar will generally provides more reliable results (by a few ms) -- but this does open up this kind of analysis to more everday ringing, and the feedback can hopefully be used to help people improve in scenarios other than just the very best 12 bell ringing.

    with st.expander("Limitations (not a complete list...)"):
        st.markdown('''
            As you might expect, the recording must be reasonably clear -- if you can't pick out all the bells most of the time then this probably won't manage it. Some towers just work better than others. Anything which works for HawkEar *should* be OK here though, and please let me know if you find something that doesn't (apart from St. Paul's Cathedral, I know it doesn't like it there).\\
            $~$ \\
            The algorithm is designed to look for rhythmic, open handstroke ringing. Analysing bad ringing can be quite amusing but once the rhythm is lost it's difficult for it to figure out and sometimes it'll go terribly weong. \\
            $~$ \\
            Currently the algorithms for finding the 'ideal' striking times are my own - the 'team model' seems to be reasonably consistent with the current 'contest model' used in Strikeometer, but there are some notable differences. I have added the RWP striking model for direct comparisons if neccessary"

                * In-browser recording added (a popular request)
                * Added RWP striking model as an option on the Analyse Striking page
                * Added a plain text striking report for each touch, identifying things which can be improved for each bell. Works using confidence intervals so can identify plenty which isn't obvious from the graphs themselves
                * Made some minor changes to the timing identification to try to improve the accuracy. Now usually within 5ms of HawkEar, from what I've tested.

                    Also automated more of the frequency reinforcement, and fixed some bugs with the method detection when things fire out.
